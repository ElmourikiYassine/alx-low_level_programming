### Tasks:

#### Task 0: strcat

**Description:**
Write a function that concatenates two strings. This function appends the `src` string to the `dest` string, overwriting the terminating null byte (`'\0'`) at the end of `dest`, and then adds a terminating null byte. The function should return a pointer to the resulting string `dest`.

#### Task 1: strncat

**Description:**
Write a function that concatenates two strings. This function is similar to `strcat`, but it will use at most `n` bytes from `src`. Also, `src` does not need to be null-terminated if it contains `n` or more bytes. The function should return a pointer to the resulting string `dest`.

#### Task 2: strncpy

**Description:**
Write a function that copies a string. This function should work exactly like `strncpy`, which means it copies at most `n` characters from `src` to `dest`. If `src` has fewer than `n` characters, the remainder of `dest` will be padded with null bytes. The function should return a pointer to the resulting string `dest`.

#### Task 3: strcmp

**Description:**
Write a function that compares two strings. It should work exactly like `strcmp`, returning an integer value indicating the difference between the two strings (0 if they are equal).

#### Task 4: Reverse Array

**Description:**
Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

#### Task 5: string_toupper

**Description:**
Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

#### Task 6: cap_string

**Description:**
Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string. Words are separated by space, tabulation, new line, ',', ';', '.', '!', '?', '"', '(', ')', and '{'.

#### Task 7: leet

**Description:**
Write a function that encodes a string into 1337. The following substitutions should be made:
- 'a' and 'A' should be replaced by '4'
- 'e' and 'E' should be replaced by '3'
- 'o' and 'O' should be replaced by '0'
- 't' and 'T' should be replaced by '7'
- 'l' and 'L' should be replaced by '1'

#### Task 8: rot13

**Description:**
Write a function that encodes a string using rot13.

#### Task 9: print_number

**Description:**
Write a function that prints an integer.

#### Task 10: infinite_add

**Description:**
Write a function that adds two numbers represented as strings.

#### Task 11: print_buffer

**Description:**
Write a function that prints the content of a buffer with a specific format. The buffer will be printed in hexadecimal, showing 10 bytes per line, along with the corresponding ASCII representation.
